# Day 1 - What is Machine learning?

Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn from examples, just like how you learn from experience. Imagine you're teaching a dog to recognize different fruits. At first, you show the dog an apple and say, "This is an apple." Then, you show it a banana and say, "This is a banana." The dog starts to notice patterns and differences between the two fruits.

Machine learning works similarly. Instead of a dog, we have a computer. Instead of fruits, we have data (like pictures of apples and bananas). The computer learns by looking at many examples and figuring out patterns on its own. It learns to recognize the differences between apples and bananas without being explicitly programmed.

There are different types of machine learning, but a common one is called "supervised learning." In supervised learning, you provide the computer with a bunch of labeled examples. For instance, you give the computer lots of pictures of cats and dogs, each labeled as "cat" or "dog." The computer learns to associate features in the pictures (like ears, tails, and fur patterns) with their labels.

Later, when you give the computer a new picture it hasn't seen before, it uses what it learned to guess whether it's a cat or a dog based on the patterns it found in the training examples.

So, in simple terms, machine learning is teaching computers to learn from examples and make educated guesses or predictions about new things they haven't seen before.

Example:
Let's say you want to build a machine learning model to predict whether a given email is spam or not. You start by providing the model with thousands of emails that are already labeled as spam or not spam. The model learns the patterns in these emails that make them spammy or legitimate.

Then, when you receive a new email that the model hasn't seen, it analyzes the words, phrases, and other features in the email and makes a prediction based on what it learned from the training examples. If it thinks the email looks similar to known spam emails, it predicts that it's spam. If it resembles genuine emails, it predicts that it's not spam. This way, the model helps you filter out unwanted emails.
